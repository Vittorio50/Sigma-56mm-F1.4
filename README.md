Data calibration for lens Sigma 56mm F1.4 Contemporary
I tested my Sigma 56mm f/1.4 art contemporary on my sony alpha 6600 following step by step the procedure found in
https://pixls.us/articles/create-lens-calibration-data-for-lensfun/ by andreas schneider on a pc with linux ubuntu 20.04.
Putting the lensfun.xml file into $HOME/.local/share/lensfun directory and using darktable, 
the correction of distortion, tca, and vignetting turned out to be absolutely satisfactory to me.
